## Why engineering

I got tired of talking about things that worked. I wanted to make them work.

Three startups later, I'm mass-converting English fluency into system design. Turns out "how do I explain this clearly" and "how do I structure this cleanly" are the same question.

## Highlighted work

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### HeyContext
Multi-agent workspace shipped with PersistOS.  
Redis-backed async, structured outputs, agents that pass notes to each other.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### The Convergence
Agent framework built around selection pressure.  
Behaviors get scored. Bad ones die. Published to PyPI.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Vector Native
Compact A2A format for machine-readable coordination.  
~3x density. Less ambiguity between agents.

## Current repos (hands-on)

- **neural-polygraph** — SAE-based hallucination detection. Spectral + geometric probes, runners, visualizations
- **experiments** — ML run patterns: append-only specimens, Parquet artifacts, DuckDB catalog

---

## What I actually do

**Ship things**
- 6 hackathon wins (AWS, Google Cloud, Agno, Wordware, etc.)
- Each one: 24-48 hours, working code, judges who said yes
- Some became real products

**Debug things**
- Agent orchestration that fails silently
- Context windows that overflow
- Pipelines that work on my machine

**Learn things fast**
- Zero Swift → TestFlight app in 2 months
- Zero agent experience → production multi-agent system in 4 months
- Pattern: find the hard part, sit in it until it clicks

---

## Build style

**Production-minded**
- Packaging, CLIs, setup verification
- Docs that assume zero context
- "Runs on a fresh machine" as a requirement

**Research-capable**
- Experiments that leave queryable outputs
- Metrics you can regenerate
- Minimal magic, maximal traceability
