```
Writer turned engineer. I spent years studying how language creates meaning.
Now I apply that to how machines communicate.
```

English was never my first language, but it's always been my favorite subject. I spent most of my life reading and writing—debating ideas, reporting stories, diving into text. Then I discovered computer science and realized it was just writing. Different syntax, different rules, but writing all the same.

**I transitioned because I want to build, not sell.**

## Currently Building

**[HeyContext](https://github.com/persist-os)** — Multi-agent orchestration workspace where families of specialized agents coordinate autonomously. Messages become execution commands. Agents write A2A notes, generate prompts on-demand, iterate every time.

*The bottleneck isn't individual agent capability—it's coordination overhead.*

---

## Thesis

```
Coordination > Capability
```

Most people are optimizing for the wrong things. They're building chatbots when they should be building coordination systems. They're replacing human thought instead of augmenting it.

AI should give people back their time. Use AI to synthesize research, not do it. Use AI to build systems, not have mindless conversations. Use AI as infrastructure for human intelligence, not as a replacement for it.

## Open Source

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### [The Convergence](https://github.com/persist-os/the-convergence)
Self-improving agent framework with evolutionary pressure. Weak behaviors die. Strong behaviors survive.

**Winner: RL Track @ WeaveHacks**  
`pip install the-convergence`

</td>
<td width="50%">

### [Vector Native](https://github.com/persist-os/vector-native)
A2A communication protocol with **~3x semantic density**. Natural language is inefficient for agent coordination—ambiguity, wasted tokens, latency.

Symbols trigger pre-trained statistical patterns.

## Writing

I write about agent coordination, memory systems, and AI architecture on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ariaxhan).

- [Stop Building Chatbots](https://medium.com/@ariaxhan/part-1-stop-building-chatbots-why-we-killed-the-conversation-to-fix-ai-698641d5cfa2) — Why most AI products are architecturally wrong
- [Beyond RAG](https://medium.com/@ariaxhan/part-2-beyond-rag-building-living-context-and-evolutionary-agents-ab7b270fb6aa) — Building context that evolves, not just retrieves
- [Latency & Logic](https://medium.com/@ariaxhan/latency-logic-why-we-need-a-vector-aligned-syntax-6b7f832603b9) — Why we need vector-aligned syntax
- [Cursor as Agent Civilization](https://medium.com/@ariaxhan/how-i-turned-cursor-into-a-self-learning-agent-civilization-7a149e6f34e8) — Orchestration platform, not coding speed
